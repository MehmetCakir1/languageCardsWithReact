* In this project I used useState Hook that I have recently learnt.<br>
* Apart from that, I used props,components,map method,grid layout.<br>
* When you click the logo of one of the languages,it displays some information about that language for 3 seconds.<br.
* In three seconds,you will see the card you clicked displays its logo again.<br>
I added this functionality with setTimeout function.
